# Semester-Project

The Program is hydropnic greenshouse simulator that will run within the console. The program will keep track of many differnet varibles such as temperature, humidity, light, water nutrients, PH, and the air pump. Along with three different plants.
Whenever the clock is moved forward, the program will behave as if one hour has passed. So the environment in the room will change randomly, so a pump breaking or the power going out could happen. The system will work on correcting these issues, and each plant will show its health and growth based on how the good or bad the conditions are. 
The user will also be provided a menu to see the current environment status, add/remove plants, or change targets of the greenhouse, refill the tank, turn the pump on or off, along with clearing any problems. Over time, we will see whether the plants will stay healthy or which ones will struggle based on the environment.
